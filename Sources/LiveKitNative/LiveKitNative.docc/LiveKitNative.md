# ``LiveKitNative``

Build LiveKit clients with native Swift signaling, room state, media adapters,
and data APIs.

## Overview

`LiveKitNative` is an independent Swift 6 package for iOS and macOS. The package
keeps LiveKit client logic in Swift and builds toward a tiny internal
`LiveKitNativeWebRTC` engine for media transport.

Milestone 0 establishes the package structure and public API shape. Milestone
0.1 adds signaling groundwork and a small SDP parser/writer foundation for the
native WebRTC engine.
